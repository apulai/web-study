<h3>Dice game</h3>

<p>Roll the dice and see who wins. This was a challange in an Udemy course.
In the course we used images, here I manipulate CSS properties instead.
I learned here the easy way of adding and removig CSS classes.
<code>document.querySelector(".player1wins").classList.remove("hidden");</code>
<code>document.querySelector(".player2wins").classList.add("hidden");</code>
</p>

<h3>Simon game</h3>

<p>Try to remember and play back the tunes the computer genereated.
This was a challange called <em>Simon's Game</em> from an Udemy course.

<h3>Bootstrap caroussel</h3>
<p>This a small Bootstrap test. I liked the Caroussel widget most. <br>
But in my Bootstrap folder there are other studies as well.

<h3>Bootstrap Responsive layout</h3>
<p>Mobile first, is really key in these years. I've studied responsive layout with this micro project.

<h3>
TodoList app
</h3>
<p>This is a <em>node.js</em> based application with <em>Express</em> and <em>Mongoose</em>.
The aim is to create a ToDo list application.
The backend is mongodb running on the same host, as the main application.<br>
To test it you have to install node.js on your host. I've used an LTS version from
<a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">https://nodejs.org/en/</a>.
First init the package repo with <code>node init</code>,
then download the node.js packages with <code>node -i</code>, finally run the app with <code>node app.js</code>
For mongodb I've used <code>docker pull mongodb</code>. Start your container with
<code>docker run -d -p: 27017:27017 mongo</code>.
Finally direct your browser to <code>http://localhost:3000/</code>

<a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/keeper-using-pre-built-react-components-finish-e8w88">
React based note application called Keeper
</a>
</h3>
<p>This is a React based application hosted on codesandbox.
On my udemy course we finished with a React App. To get here We have created 30+ mini React studies to understand how React works.
Learning about keeping the state and using hooks was really interesting.
