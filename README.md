        <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/apulai/web-study/blob/main/fridgecalendar/calendar-grid.html"><h3>Fridge calendar</h3></a>
        <p>This is a project for printing a family calendar. I've studied the grid layout in this project.
          I also added Javascript code from https://gml.noaa.gov/grad/solcalc/sunrise.html to calculate
          sun-rise and sun-set times, as well as moon phases.

          <h3>Catan study</h3>
        </a>

        <p>This is a project for testing SVG. I wanted to create a Catan like playfield on screen.
          You can add routes and cities. You can roll the dice and check the outcome on the JS console.
          You can also observe who got points.
